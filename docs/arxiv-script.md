# ArXiv script

arXiv script is a program written in the [python](http://www.python.org/) programming language that accesses information on papers from the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org/).  It can access title, author, abstract, comments and journal reference records.  It can also download the paper's PDF, PS or source.  Although originally written for the GNU/Linux command line, the code should be portable enough to run on any operating system with a python interpreter.

### download
Download [arxiv.py](arxiv-py.md).

### installation on a GNU/Linux system
The script requires the python interpreter to be installed on your system.  This is automatically installed on most GNU/Linux distributions, but check it is there by typing
<pre>
python
</pre>
at the command line and see what happens.

If python is present download [arxiv.py](arxiv-py.md) and run it by typing
<pre>
python arxiv.py hep-th/9711200
</pre>

### usage
The only accepted inputs are the usual arXiv references
<pre>
python arxiv.py hep-th/9711200
python arxiv.py 0705.0303
</pre>

If no options are specified all possible outputs will be displayed

The Large N Limit of Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity
Juan M. Maldacena
We show that the large $N$ limit of certain conformal field theories in
various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing
supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other
compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string
theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane
decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the
near horizon geometry for large $N$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near
horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in
the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't
Hooft limit of 4-d ${\cal N} =4$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is
shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that
compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are
dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a
definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact
dimensions.

### technical details
The code is very modular so it is easy to write your own programs using the functions defined in arxiv.py.  Just import the functions in arxiv.py with <code>import arxiv</code>.
